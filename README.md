## R Code for the paper "Inference for multivariate extremes via a semi-parametric angular-radial model"

This repository contains the code required for the inference techniques introduced in Murphy-Barltrop et al. (2024). These files can be used to recreate plots from the paper, and to estimate all relevant quantities of interest. 

* master_functions.R - this file contains all functions and packages required for performing inference
* gaussian_data_example.R - this file illustrates how the master functions can be easily applied to a simulated dataset from a Gaussian copula
* metocean_data_example.R - this file illustrates how the master functions can be easily applied to the metocean datasets considered in the case study of Murphy-Barltrop et al. (2024). 

The `datafiles' folder contains some .rds files required for running the example scripts.

Please get in touch if you have any questions, or if you find a bug in the code. My email is callum.murphy-barltrop[at]tu-dresden.de 

Happy SPAR-ring!
