## R Code for the paper "Inference for multivariate extremes via a semi-parametric angular-radial model"

This repository contains the code required for the inference techniques introduced in Murphy-Barltrop et al. (2024). Each file has a different purpose 

* master_functions.R - this file contains all functions and packages required for performing inference
* dataset1.rds - this file contains one of the metocean datasets considered in the case study of Murphy-Barltrop et al. (2024)
* example_script.R - this file illustrates how the master functions can be easily applied to the metocean dataset. Can be used to recreate plots produced in the data

Please get in touch if you have any questions, or if you find a bug in part of the code. Enjoy playing around!
