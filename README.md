# SPAR
Code for inference using the semi-parametric angular-radial (SPAR) framework 

This repository contains code for fitting the SPAR model, based on the approach outlined in Murphy-Barltrop et al. (2024). Figures from the paper can be easily reproduced, as well as the simulation study results. Furthermore, we provide general modelling frameworks for the SPAR approach, both in L1 and L2 coordinate systems.
